 Jackie Selebi’s defence team closed its case in the South Gauteng High Court on Friday morning. Closing argument by both parties will commence on June 7. Apart from himself, Selebi called six witness to testify in his defence, including the former KwaZulu-Natal Scorpions boss Lawrence Mrwebi. Mrwebi and National Prosecuting Authority integrity management unit member Prince Mokotedi testified about the alleged conspiracy against Selebi by the Scorpions. Selebi’s advocate closed his case on Friday without calling any high-ranking current or former policeman. Judge Meyer Joffe postponed the matter until June 7 for oral closing argument to be made. Before that both parties will file written argument to Joffe.
