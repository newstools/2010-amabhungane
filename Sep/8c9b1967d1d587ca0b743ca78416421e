 Former police chief Jackie Selebi was granted leave to appeal only one aspect of his conviction by the South Gauteng High Court on Monday morning. Judge Meyer Joffe rejected the majority of Selebi’s arguments why he should be granted leave to appeal his conviction and sentencing and only allowed Selebi to argue one ground before the Supreme Court of Appeal — that he received cash bribes from drug-dealer Glenn Agliotti. This is a setback for Selebi and his legal team who planned to argue before the SCA in Bloemfontein that he did not receive a fair trial, that Joffe should have recused himself from the case and that he was maliciously prosecuted. Selebi’s legal team will now have to limit their arguments to save him from imprisonment to evidence that he received money from Agliotti. Selebi was convicted of corruption in July after Joffe found he received R166 000 in cash and clothes for his children from Agliotti. He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.
