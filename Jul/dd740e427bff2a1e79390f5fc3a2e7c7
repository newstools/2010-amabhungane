 Jackie Selebi was a “hands-on” police boss who was well respected by his senior colleagues and brought a lot of expertise to the South African Police Service (SAPS). This was the evidence of former Mpumalanga and Limpopo provincial police commissioner Denn Alberts in the South Gauteng High Court on Wednesday morning. Alberts was called by the defence to testify in mitigation of sentence for Selebi. He started giving evidence after the court accepted an order by the Asset Forfeiture Unit to freeze R230 000-worth of assets of Selebi following his conviction on a charge of corruption. Alberts had 39 years experience as a policeman and ended his career in 2005 as inspector general of the SAPS. He was recalled by Selebi to act in this position from 2006 to 2008. The grey-suited Alberts, now retired, told the court that Selebi often visited police stations in rural areas and intervened when he thought there was a shortage of vehicles or cellphones. He also attended police roadblocks and scolded Gauteng provincial commissioner Perumal Naidoo for not having enough visible police vehicles on the roads in his province. Senior police officers were often frustrated by Selebi’s open-door policy that saw junior policemen occupying his office for long periods. Selebi knew what was happening on ground-level and Alberts recalled an incident where Selebi told the police to put up lights at an Alexandra taxi-rank where the women’s toilets were covered in the dark “I have great respect for him … He was a brilliant leader who taught me a lot.” Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked Alberts what he thought of a policeman who took money from other people. “That is unacceptable,” Alberts replied. Joffe found on July 2 that Selebi received money and gifts from drug-dealer Glenn Agliotti. In exchange Selebi attended meetings at Agliotti’s beck and call and showed Agliotti top secret reports implicating him in crime.
