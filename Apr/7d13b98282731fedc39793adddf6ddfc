 The state has accused former police boss Jackie Selebi of changing his evidence to distance himself from drug lord Glenn Agliotti. “It fits you to change your version, Mr Selebi, it fits you,” said chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel as he listed the number of times Selebi has allegedly altered his evidence. While the state is trying to prove Agliotti’s influence over Selebi, the former top cop attempted to convince the court on Monday that he initiated meetings with the Kebble family and others himself. After Roger Kebble’s arrest by police at OR Tambo International Airport, Selebi attended a meeting with Kebble’s son, late mining boss Brett Kebble, at the Kebble house to discuss the circumstances surrounding the arrest. According to Selebi, the Kebbles were unhappy with the presence of private intelligence operative Warren Goldblatt at Roger Kebble’s arrest. “So you discussed the fact of the matter with the son of an accused?” asked Nel, to which Selebi replied: “I was not discussing the investigation, I was discussing the arrest at the airport. Their problem was the fact the he was arrested at the airport.” Nel said it was “premature” of Selebi to give an accused’s family detail of what happened in an investigation. Selebi said he “saw nothing wrong”. After citing other alleged meetings between Selebi and people under investigation by the police, Nel said: “You assisted your friends, Mr Selebi. You were available and you took steps. But at least you assisted your friends.” Cross-examination continues. Follow amaBhungane on Twitter
